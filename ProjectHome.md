This project implements algorithms for [aglomerative hierarchical clustering](AglomerativeHierarchicalClustering.md). Its purpose is to serve for demonstrations and experiments in school or university. The code is developed with the intention to be easily extensible and easy to understand.

Regretfully, the authors of the project chose windows specific visualization of the algorithm using openGL functions in Visual Studio. The pros from that is that the graphics are cooler and 3D.

Anyone who is interested is encouraged to download the code and experiment as much as he likes with it. Refer to [the wiki](Overview.md) if you encounter any problems in setting up, running or extending.

The project was developed in Sofia University as part of the requirements for "Data mining" course in "Artificial Intelligence" master program. The authors are Boris Strandjev and Ivaylo Strandjev.
