#summary Home page of the hierarchical clustering project

= Introduction =

This project implements several algorithms for aglomerative hierarchical clustering and provides functionality to visualize the result in 3D.


= Project Components =
The project has several main components.

== Settings configuration ==
A separate component written in java is used to perform the initial settings configuration of the project.

== Clustering algorithm ==
A component written in c++ that implements the actual clustering. It reads the input from a file and builds the clustering hierarchy according to the configuration. It can use several different measures for [DistanceMeasures distance] and for [UnknownValuesHandling handling of unknown values].

== Visualization ==
A component written in C++ using OpenGL. As meaningful visualization can be done on for up to three dimensional space, the visualization component can be passed a mapping of the actual objects in up to three dimensions. This way only a projection of the actual space will be used to visualize the clustering.
